# Family Chore Tracker - SIMPLE DEPLOYMENT

## If your previous deployment failed:

### Option 1: Replace files in GitHub (EASIEST)

1. **Go to your GitHub repo**: https://github.com/jilljilljilljilljilljill/fictional-system
2. **Click into the `chore-tracker` folder**
3. **Delete ALL files inside** (keep the folder, just delete its contents)
4. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
5. **Drag ALL the files from this new download** (package.json, index.html, vite.config.js, and src folder)
6. **Commit changes**
7. **Vercel will auto-redeploy** in 2-3 minutes

### Option 2: Fresh Start

If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. Delete the Vercel project completely
2. Delete the GitHub repo completely
3. Create new GitHub repo: `family-chore-tracker`
4. Upload these files to the ROOT (not in a folder)
5. Import to Vercel
6. Make sure Root Directory is BLANK (or just `.`)
7. Deploy
